 Chief Etah Ako-Onitsa1 left an unhealthy relationship in Austell, GA on March 5, 2023 at 4am. Thank goodness he left still standing though he had been progressively been poisoned by his partner of 8 years who had been indulging in extramarital affairs in their marital home, in the homes of her side-guys and in hotel rooms. Their separation led to a court case filed by his partner for defamation of character and he was prohibited from going anywhere near the property they had jointly acquired at 6133 Glade Ct, Austell, GA 30168.
 Chief Etah now enjoys peace, love, respect and tranquility with his new wife in Charlotte, NC where they run a small family business.
